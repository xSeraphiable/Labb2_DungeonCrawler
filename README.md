<h1>What is this?</h1>
This project was created as my second assignment at IT-högskolan, about one month into learning C#.  
<br>We had 2.5 weeks to build a simple Dungeon Crawler game. 
<br>Instead of procedural generation, the game uses a predefined map (Level1.txt) containing walls, enemies, and a player start position.
<br>The focus of the project was on object-oriented programming — each entity (player, enemies, walls) manages its own data and behavior.
